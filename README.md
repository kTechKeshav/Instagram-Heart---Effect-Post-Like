Overview: 
This project features a responsive webpage that provides users with an engaging experience akin to popular social media platforms. With a dynamic mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation, users can interact with a series of random images that refresh every 3 seconds. Inspired by Instagram, the transition effect for liking a post adds a delightful touch to the user experience, enhancing engagement and enjoyment.

Key Features: 
Random Image Showcase: Explore a curated collection of random images that refresh automatically, offering a fresh experience with every visit.
Interactive Post Liking: Double-tap on image post to express your appreciation by liking the post. Experience the familiar heart animation reminiscent of Instagram.
Real-time Liked Post Count: Keep track of your interactions effortlessly. After each double tap anywhere on the image post, the webpage dynamically displays the count of liked posts.
